In Nike's supply chain context, **GAC** typically stands for **Global Allocation Commit**, which refers to the process or timeline when Nike commits to the allocation of products to various distribution channels, regions, or partners. This process ensures that inventory is effectively distributed to meet demand across global markets.

### **GAC Date**
The **GAC Date** is the specific date by which Nike finalizes and locks in the product allocation decisions. This is a critical milestone in the supply chain because:

1. **Demand Fulfillment**: It aligns product availability with projected regional or channel-specific demand.
2. **Production Planning**: It provides clear directives to factories and logistics teams regarding shipping and delivery schedules.
3. **Inventory Optimization**: It minimizes overstock or understock situations by confirming quantities per market.
4. **Logistics Coordination**: It helps logistics teams plan transportation and warehousing needs efficiently.

In summary, the GAC date is essential for ensuring that Nikeâ€™s supply chain operations are synchronized with market demands, production schedules, and global logistics.
